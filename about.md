Hello world, my name is Konstantinos Psychas.

I grew up in Athens and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in
[National Technical University of Athens][NTUA].

One of the greatest highlights of my life are the bronze medal I got in
[IMO 2006] and completing my PhD degree in the
[Electrical Engineering department of Columbia University][CU]
where I was supervised by [Prof. Javad Ghaderi][JG].

For more information about me you can take a look at my [short CV][cv] and any
activity I have in my linked profiles at the bottom.
