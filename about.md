I am currently a Columbia University PhD student trying to make an impact.

I grew up in Athens and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in [National
Technical University of Athens][NTUA].

What I consider my greatest achievement so far is a bronze medal in [IMO 2006].

For more information about me you can take a look at my [short CV][cv] and any 
activity I have in my linked profiles at the bottom.
