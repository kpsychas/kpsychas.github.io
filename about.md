I am a Columbia University PhD candidate working with
[Prof. Javad Ghaderi][JG].
My research interests are in the areas of network algorithms and
performance analysis of datacenters.

I grew up in Athens and studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in
[National Technical University of Athens][NTUA].

What I consider my greatest achievement so far is the bronze medal I got in
[IMO 2006].

For more information about me you can take a look at my [short CV][cv] and any
activity I have in my linked profiles at the bottom.
